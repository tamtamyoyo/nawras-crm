# GitHub Actions Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
The GitHub Actions workflow is configured correctly, but deployment failures may occur due to several potential issues.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Network Connectivity
- **Problem**: Unable to push to GitHub repository due to network connectivity issues
- **Error**: `Failed to connect to github.com port 443`
- **Impact**: Prevents triggering new deployments

### 2. Missing GitHub Secrets
The workflow requires several secrets that may not be configured:

#### Required Secrets:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel authentication token
- `ORG_ID`: Vercel organization ID
- `PROJECT_ID`: Vercel project ID
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

#### How to Configure:
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Get from Vercel dashboard → Settings → Tokens
   - `ORG_ID`: Get from Vercel project settings
   - `PROJECT_ID`: Get from Vercel project settings

### 3. Vercel Project Configuration
- **Issue**: Project may not be properly linked to Vercel
- **Solution**: Ensure the project is imported and configured in Vercel dashboard

### 4. Branch Configuration
- **Current**: Workflow triggers on both `main` and `master` branches
- **Status**: Local branch is `master`, remote has both `main` and `master`
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on one branch (preferably `main`)

## Workflow Analysis

### Current Workflow Steps:
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 18
3. ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. ✅ TypeScript check (`npx tsc --noEmit`) - **PASSES LOCALLY**
5. ✅ Linting (`npm run lint`) - **PASSES LOCALLY** (105 warnings, 0 errors)
6. ✅ Build (`npm run build`) - **PASSES LOCALLY**
7. ❓ Deploy to Vercel - **LIKELY FAILING DUE TO MISSING SECRETS**

### Local Test Results:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ SUCCESS
- ESLint linting: ✅ SUCCESS (warnings only)
- Vite build: ✅ SUCCESS (1.28MB main bundle)

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Get Vercel tokens and IDs from Vercel dashboard
   # Add to GitHub repository secrets
   ```

2. **Fix Network Connectivity**:
   - Check firewall settings
   - Try different network connection
   - Use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop as alternative

3. **Verify Vercel Project Setup**:
   - Ensure project is imported in Vercel
   - Check build and deployment settings
   - Verify domain configuration

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Optimize Bundle Size**:
   - Current main bundle is 1.28MB (warning threshold exceeded)
   - Consider code splitting with dynamic imports
   - Implement manual chunking strategy

2. **Reduce ESLint Warnings**:
   - 105 warnings detected (mostly unused variables)
   - Clean up unused imports and variables

3. **Standardize Branch Strategy**:
   - Choose either `main` or `master` as primary branch
   - Update workflow and repository settings accordingly

## Next Steps
1. Resolve network connectivity to push changes
2. Configure missing GitHub secrets
3. Test deployment workflow
4. Monitor deployment logs for specific errors
5. Optimize application bundle size

## Monitoring
Once connectivity is restored:
- Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs
- Monitor Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Review deployment logs for specific error messages

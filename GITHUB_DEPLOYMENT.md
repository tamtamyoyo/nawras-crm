# GitHub Actions Deployment Guide

## Overview
This project is configured for automated deployment using GitHub Actions. All deployments are handled exclusively through GitHub workflows, eliminating the need for manual Vercel deployments.

## Workflow Configuration
The deployment workflow is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and triggers on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branches

## Required GitHub Secrets
To enable automated deployment, configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Repository Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**
   - Your Vercel authentication token
   - Get from: Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Tokens
   - Scope: Account-level token with deployment permissions

2. **ORG_ID**
   - Your Vercel organization/team ID
   - Get from: Vercel Dashboard > Settings > General
   - Format: `team_xxxxxxxxxx` or `user_xxxxxxxxxx`

3. **PROJECT_ID**
   - Your Vercel project ID
   - Get from: Vercel Project Settings > General
   - Format: `prj_xxxxxxxxxx`

4. **GITHUB_TOKEN**
   - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
   - No manual configuration required

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment
1. Push code to `main` or `master` branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers
3. Runs TypeScript checks and linting
4. Builds the project
5. Deploys to Vercel production environment
6. Comments on PR with deployment status (for pull requests)

### Manual Deployment
If needed, you can manually trigger deployment:
1. Go to GitHub repository > Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Vercel" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Choose branch and run

## Workflow Steps
1. **Checkout code** - Downloads repository content
2. **Setup Node.js** - Installs Node.js 18 with npm cache
3. **Install dependencies** - Runs `npm ci` for clean install
4. **TypeScript check** - Validates TypeScript compilation
5. **Linting** - Runs ESLint checks
6. **Build project** - Creates production build
7. **Deploy to Vercel** - Pushes to Vercel production
8. **PR Comment** - Adds success comment to pull requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured
2. **Build Failures**: Check TypeScript and linting errors
3. **Deployment Errors**: Verify Vercel token permissions
4. **Network Issues**: GitHub Actions will retry automatically

### Monitoring Deployments
- View deployment status in GitHub Actions tab
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment logs
- Monitor build output in workflow runs

## Benefits of GitHub Actions Deployment
- **Automated**: No manual intervention required
- **Consistent**: Same process for all deployments
- **Traceable**: Full deployment history in GitHub
- **Secure**: Secrets managed by GitHub
- **Integrated**: Works with pull request workflow

## Next Steps
1. Configure required secrets in GitHub repository
2. Push changes to trigger first automated deployment
3. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions tab
4. Verify successful deployment on Vercel

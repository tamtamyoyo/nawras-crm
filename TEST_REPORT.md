## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests

#### UI Components (23/24 tests passing)
- **Card Components**: 7/7 tests passing
  - Card rendering with default classes
  - Custom className acceptance
  - CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent rendering
  - Complete card structure composition

- **Button Components**: 16/17 tests passing
  - Various button variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
  - Size variations (default, sm, lg, icon)
  - Custom className handling
  - Disabled state
  - Click event handling
  - **‚ùå 1 failing**: Focus test after keyboard interaction

#### Page Components (Fixed Mocking Issues)
- **Settings.minimal.test.tsx**: 1/1 test passing
  - Basic rendering without crashes
  - Proper authentication context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests with Issues

#### Page Component Tests
The following test files had mocking issues that were systematically fixed:

1. **Dashboard.test.tsx** (20 tests)
   - **Issue**: `mockUseAuth.mockReturnValue is not a function`
   - **Fix Applied**: Updated mock path from `../hooks/useAuth` to `../hooks/useAuthHook`
   - **Fix Applied**: Changed `vi.mocked(useAuth)` to `(useAuth as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>)`

2. **Customers.test.tsx** (28 tests)
   - **Issue**: Same mocking issue as Dashboard
   - **Fix Applied**: Same mocking fixes applied

3. **Settings.test.tsx** (Multiple tests)
   - **Issue**: Two instances of incorrect mocking
   - **Fix Applied**: Updated both mock path and mock usage patterns

4. **Calendar.test.tsx** (Multiple tests)
   - **Issue**: Incorrect mock path and usage
   - **Fix Applied**: Updated mock configuration

5. **Proposals.test.tsx** (Multiple tests)
   - **Issue**: Mock path and usage issues
   - **Fix Applied**: Corrected mock setup

### üîß Technical Issues Identified

#### 1. Test Output Retrieval Issues
- **Problem**: Some test executions show "Failed to retrieve command output"
- **Impact**: Difficult to get detailed error messages for failing tests
- **Recommendation**: Investigate terminal/command execution configuration

#### 2. Mock Configuration Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Inconsistent mock paths across test files
- **Root Cause**: Import path discrepancies between `../hooks/useAuth` and `../hooks/useAuthHook`
- **Solution Applied**: Standardized all mock paths to use `../hooks/useAuthHook`

#### 3. Focus Testing Issues
- **Problem**: Button focus test failing in UI components
- **Details**: `expect(button).toHaveFocus()` assertion fails after keyboard interaction
- **Potential Cause**: DOM focus behavior in test environment

## Test Coverage Analysis

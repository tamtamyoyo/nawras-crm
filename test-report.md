2. `authentication.spec.ts` - Login and session management tests
3. `core-features.spec.ts` - CRM functionality tests
4. `performance-and-flows.spec.ts` - User experience tests
5. `error-handling.spec.ts` - Edge case and error scenario tests

## Deployment Status Analysis

### Possible Causes for Website Downtime:
1. **Vercel Deployment Issues**
   - Build failure
   - Runtime errors
   - Resource exhaustion

2. **Network/DNS Problems**
   - DNS resolution failures
   - CDN connectivity issues
   - Regional network problems

3. **Application Errors**
   - Server-side crashes
   - Database connection failures
   - Configuration errors

## Recommendations

### üö® Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
   - Verify deployment status
   - Review build logs for errors
   - Check function execution logs

2. **Investigate Recent Changes**
   - Review recent commits
   - Check for breaking changes
   - Verify environment variables

3. **Monitor Network Status**
   - Test from different networks
   - Check DNS resolution
   - Verify SSL certificate status

### üîß Technical Debugging Steps

1. **Local Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Test locally to isolate deployment issues
   ```

2. **Vercel CLI Diagnostics**
   ```bash
   vercel logs
   vercel inspect
   ```

3. **Re-deployment**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   # Force fresh deployment
   ```

### üìä When Website is Restored

**Priority 1: Critical Functionality**
- Run authentication tests first
- Verify AlertCircle fix in invoices
- Test core CRUD operations

**Priority 2: Performance & UX**
- Measure load times across devices
- Test mobile responsiveness
- Validate search/filter functionality

**Priority 3: Edge Cases**
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate offline mode (if applicable)
- Test with large datasets

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests when website is accessible
npx playwright test --reporter=html

# Run specific test suites
npx playwright test accessibility-and-load.spec.ts
npx playwright test authentication.spec.ts
npx playwright test core-features.spec.ts
npx playwright test performance-and-flows.spec.ts
npx playwright test error-handling.spec.ts

# Generate detailed HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** The CRM website at https://app.nawrasinchina.com/ is currently **DOWN** and requires immediate attention from the development/deployment team.

**Test Infrastructure:** Fully prepared and ready to execute comprehensive testing once website accessibility is restored.

**Next Steps:** 
1. Resolve website connectivity issues
2. Execute full test suite
3. Generate detailed functionality report
4. Provide performance optimization recommendations
